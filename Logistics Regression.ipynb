    "\n",
    "## Question 1: What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y) using a straight-line equation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "The purpose of SLR is to predict the value of a dependent variable based on the value of an independent variable and to understand the strength and direction of their relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2: What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "1. Linearity – The relationship between X and Y is linear.  \n",
    "2. Independence – Observations are independent of each other.  \n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity – Constant variance of residuals.  \n",
    "4. Normality – Residuals are normally distributed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3: Write the mathematical equation for SLR and explain each term.\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Y = β0 + β1X + ε  \n",
    "\n",
    "Where:  \n",
    "- Y = Dependent variable  \n",
    "- X = Independent variable  \n",
    "- β0 = Intercept (value of Y when X = 0)  \n",
    "- β1 = Slope (change in Y for one unit change in X)  \n",
    "- ε = Error term (residual)  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4: Provide a real-world example of SLR.\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "Predicting house price (Y) based on area in square feet (X).  \n",
    "If area increases, house price typically increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5: What is the method of least squares?\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "The Method of Least Squares is used to estimate regression coefficients by minimizing the sum of squared differences between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6: What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to predict categorical outcomes (e.g., Yes/No, 0/1).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "- Linear Regression predicts continuous values.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression predicts probabilities using the sigmoid function.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression outputs values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 7: Name three common evaluation metrics for regression models.\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) – Average absolute errors.  \n",
    "2. Mean Squared Error (MSE) – Average squared errors.  \n",
    "3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) – Square root of MSE.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 8: What is the purpose of R-squared?\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable(s).  \n",
    "It ranges from 0 to 1. Higher values indicate better model fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 10: How do you interpret regression coefficients?\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "The slope (β1) represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit increase in the independent variable.  \n",
    "The intercept (β0) represents the predicted value of Y when X is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n"
