    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model specifically designed for processing grid-like data such as images. CNNs use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences from Fully Connected Networks:\n",
    "- CNNs use local receptive fields and shared weights, reducing parameters significantly.\n",
    "- Fully connected networks treat images as flattened vectors, losing spatial relationships.\n",
    "- CNNs are computationally efficient and perform better on image tasks due to feature extraction and translation invariance.\n",
    "- CNNs require fewer parameters and reduce overfitting compared to dense networks for image data.\n"
