        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. It emphasizes modularity, reusability, and abstraction using key concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior and state of its objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It contains actual values for the attributes and can use the methods defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object's components, bundling data and methods together.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods (short for “double underscore”), like __init__, __str__, and __len__, are special methods used to define the behavior of Python objects (e.g., construction, string representation, operator overloading).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows one class (child) to inherit the attributes and methods of another (parent), enabling code reuse and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, allowing the same method to behave differently on different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved by using:\n",
        "\n",
        "_single_underscore: Protected members (by convention).\n",
        "\n",
        "__double_underscore: Private members (name mangling to avoid access).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A constructor is the __init__ method in Python. It initializes new object instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",

        "\n",
        "@classmethod: Takes cls as the first argument, affects the class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod: No automatic first argument; behaves like a regular function inside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python does not support true method overloading. You typically use default arguments or *args and **args to simulate it.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overriding is when a subclass provides a new implementation of a method inherited from its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "@property allows you to define a method that can be accessed like an attribute. Used for controlled access to instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows for flexibility and reusability in code. You can write generic code that works with different types of objects seamlessly.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (defined but not implemented). Defined using abc module and @abstractmethod decorator.\n",

        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "__repr__: Unambiguous string used for debugging (repr(obj)).\n",

        "\n",
        "super() gives access to methods of a parent or sibling class. Commonly used in constructors to initialize parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. Significance of __del__ method in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Called when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected). Used for cleanup, but should be used sparingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. Difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in python\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod\n",
        "A @staticmethod is a method that does not take self or cls as its first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "It behaves like a plain function that happens to be inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "It cannot access or modify class or instance variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "@classmethod\n",
        "A @classmethod takes cls (the class itself) as its first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "It can access and modify class state, including class variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's often used for factory methods that return instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Derived classes can override methods from base classes, and the same method call can execute different behaviors based on the object type.\n",
